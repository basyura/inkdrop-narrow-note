# switch-note

Quickly search and switch between your Inkdrop note from anywhere. Inspired by the [switch-notebook](https://github.com/marconi/switch-notebook) plugin written by Marconi Moreto Jr and the JetBrains *'Go To File'* functionality.

### Installation

```
ipm install switch-note
```

### Switching Between Notes

Activate the search dialog with either `cmd+shift+o` or `ctrl+shift+o`. The search functionality supports:
 - Case-insensitive searching of both the names of your notes and your notebooks.
 - Multiple, partial, and non-sequential parameters, separated by a space (see screenshot below for an example.)
 - Arrow keys + enter key for moving through the search results and opening the desired note.
